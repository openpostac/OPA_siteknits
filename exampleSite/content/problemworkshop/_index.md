title: Expanding Data Science: Open Problem Workshop
description: This is meta description

---
Big data and machine learning are among the transformative technologies of our time, and have rewritten how we work as a society. We now face a monumental task of making our data driven world just, inclusive, equitable, safe, and accessible. This requires cross-disciplinary collaboration and new approaches to technology.

OPA approaches workshops in an intentional, collaborative and cross-disciplinary manner, so that people with PhDs can discover the real world problems that their expertise can help solve. We invite people from any discipline to join the discussion, listen to the problems and share what they know.

This year, we are developing a new approach to collaborative conversations that expand the boundaries of expert communities: open problem workshops. With our pilot run, we are inviting people with a background in data science to join discussions with post academics.

* If you have a PhD, join us to share your methods and expertise, and explore the surprising ways you can help the data science community.
* If you come from data science, share the problems you encounter that would benefit from the fresh perspectives of experts that don’t often work in data science.
* If you have a background in both academia and data science, you’re doubly invited!

We envision a world where data scientists have a deep well of expertise to work on complex societal problems and where people with a PhD offer their expertise with attention to the needs of the data science community.

**Save this date: June 30, 2021 at noon PT/3:00pm ET** for our inaugural event. [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JHzKF3Mfsi021Ey4vKVKwIRQXvN40SfkXSilHJtTpUY/edit) if you’d like us to send you a note when registration is available.
