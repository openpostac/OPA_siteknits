### **Upcoming Events and Coffee Chats**

We conduct all of our events under the [**OPA Code of Conduct**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSDndyEifMT03KAXBs22KHpFRWOa4Gld5vEOoKdcRmyDzQrrsktelKa1jRf9_JeYrC18cjEvce_i3Ri/pub  "OPA Code of Conduct").

We host workshops and conversations about topics relevant to Post Academics. If you’re ABD or have a PhD, you are welcome to join us.

We also host Coffee Chats on Fridays at 12 noon Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8) as a relaxed way for folks to talk to other post acs and make connections. Events are free of charge and a great way to connect to the OPA community.
