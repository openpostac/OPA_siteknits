We are an international, interdisciplinary, collaborative, peer-led community that empowers people with a PhD to bring their knowledge and expertise to the world.

* We create an online community
* We support each other to take the next step

## Why it Matters

The academy is changing immeasurably. We need new systems and networks to support people with a PhD to do their work outside of academia.

We acknowledge the toxicity of the academic system and we name its misogynistic, racist, and classist dimensions. We’re here to acknowledge the difficulty of moving away from the toxicity and the challenge of shifting and transforming the academic system. We advocate for healing.

We know how hard it is. We’re not here to tell you what to do. We’re here to help you figure out what skills and knowledge you can share with the world and to help you do it.
