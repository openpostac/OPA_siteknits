I can’t help it — even though I’m not a professor anymore, I’m still a data junkie. I want to find out what people ACTUALLY have to say about a topic I’m interested in.

Which is why when I started the Athenas group for women who have left or are considering leaving the academy, I asked them to tell me what they wished they had known before they left the academy.

What can I say, I like data.

I was completely unprepared for how thoughtful and honest the responses would be. I should have expected it — but wow, these women are SO sharp.

## “No one in professional life outside the academy thinks it’s weird to leave the academy.”

I wrote a white paper to share what these women told me. Here are the major findings:

* Leaving the academy is a big identity shift that takes time and is often filled with emotional turmoil.
* Women talked about the academy as a fundamentally broken system, that is unfair to women and minorities and not a meritocracy.
* Non-academics outside the academy think it’s completely reasonable and normal to leave the academy. They also value the skills Ph.D.’s bring to their work.
* The number one tip for people leaving the academy was to network, network, network.
* The respondents described being happy.

And a few selected quotes that blew me away:

> “You’re not worthless and neither is your degree. Academia is great at convincing us we have no value. If you can get yourself to a place where you see the value in yourself and your abilities/education beyond academia, you’ll start seeing possibilities again. And that’s a really hopeful, abundant feeling.”
>
> “Know that the academy routinely expects sacrifices that may be untenable and that it’s not the only place where learning and teaching happen.”
>
> “I wish I had known there were networks of people that actually got each other jobs/gigs. That networking could actually have tangible $ outcomes.”
>
> “There is so much intellectual freedom outside the academy.”
>
> “That it would feel so liberating, and that people would take me so seriously.”
>
> “Post academic does not mean unacademic.”
>
> “I wish I knew how many smart people in my field… are outside academia and happy.”
