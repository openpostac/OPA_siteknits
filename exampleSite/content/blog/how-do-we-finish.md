Welcome back to Jumpstarting Open Projects! This is week 4 of 4 (Check out weeks [1](/blog/what-is-an-open-project), [2](/blog/what-support-do-you-need), and [3](/blog/how-do-we-take-action/)). Follow along as OPA leads a group of workshop participants through the full production cycle of a project that will help them share their knowledge with the world. You can do an open project, too!

### **Week 4: Stuff that Comes Up at the End**

To kick off the final meeting, everyone reflected on what they liked and disliked about wrapping up projects.

On the positive side, folks enjoyed being able to cross off a task (“to-do list dopamine hit”), feeling freer, and having something tangible to point to and share with others.

But people also felt like being done doesn’t mean the judgment stops. Participants wrote about the need to continually tweak, the fear of putting it out there, the looming next thing on the list. A sense of loss: “Destination never as good as the journey.” A pressure: “I feel like I’m supposed to ‘feel’ something that I don’t feel.”

### **Roadblocks to Finishing**

Sometimes a project is really done, but we can’t bring ourselves to share it. Why?

Participants identified shame and perfectionism as big drivers of procrastination, noting that there’s a “fight, flight, freeze” response happening around the idea of the work not being good enough or done enough. We judge ourselves, worry that our instincts are off, and fear what we’ve made is riddled with errors or crosses certain boundaries.

One comment in particular sums up the associated self-talk: “Can always be better.”

What’s under all that fear? Workshop participants shared what frightened them, and judgment came up multiple times—self-judgment and others’ judgment—as well as the consequences of judgment: “not getting future work,” “crashing and burning,” being attacked, letting people down, and letting oneself down (“the best I can do isn’t really that great”). Failing and “being broken” also came up in the discussion.

Crashing, burning, brokenness—we imagine that if the project goes down, we’re going down with it. As one participant put it, it’s “hard to disassociate your work from you the person.”

Even a positive reception could be scary, as folks wrote about fears of overexposure, of “being too good—too seen.”

### **Tools, Tips, and Strategies to Clear the Final Hurdle**

Despite the emotions surfacing close to the finish line, participants shared a desire to meet the challenge and complete their open projects. So, everyone considered a final question: “What would help you finish?”

Folks wrote about

* making the original goal smaller
* using Pomodoros for a sense of incremental progress
* capping the amount of time to ultimately spend (see:[ Parkinson’s Law](https://lawsofux.com/parkinsons-law/))
* lowering too-high standards (e.g. shitty first drafts)
* leaning into community for accountability
* reading Seth Godin’s work on[ shipping](https://99u.adobe.com/articles/6249/seth-godin-the-truth-about-shipping),[ fear of shipping](https://seths.blog/2010/06/fear-of-shipping/), and the[ Ship It Journal](https://seths.blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/theshipitjournal.pdf)
* “turning on the bureaucratic part of yourself to overcome the anxiety around submitting/finishing” and/or having another person “pull the trigger” to send it off

In discussing the value of open projects, OPA’s Beth Duckles reflected that they are not just about sharing knowledge with the world, but about tapping into what she calls the juice, the fire for those subjects and questions that might have originally led folks to grad school: “What openness says in response to somebody who loves a topic is _please love this topic more. Love it and share it with more people_.”

### **Love Your Work and Share It Widely**

We want to hear about your open project! What did you make? What helped you finish? Share in the comments! We can’t wait to celebrate with you 🎉🎉🎉🎉
